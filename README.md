## Capital One BikeShare
-------------------------
https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/bikeshare-data
Capital One's January Software Engineering Summit (SES). A coding challenge through MindSumo in which data on Capital One's bikeshare program was provided. The objective of this was to build a web app that analyzes and visualizes bike share data from the city of Los Angeles

##Criteria
--------------------------
- Data Visuals: Display or graph 3 metrics or trends from the data set that are interesting to you.
- Which start/stop stations are most popular?
- What is the average distance traveled?
- How many riders include bike sharing as a regular part of their commute?

##Bonus
--------------------------
- How does ridership change with seasons? Types of passes used, trip duration, etc
- Is there a net change of bikes over the course of a day? If so, when and
- where should bikes be transported in order to make sure bikes match travel patterns?
- What is the breakdown of Trip Route Category-Passholder type combinations? What might make a particular combination more popular?

##Build
1.  Graphs 
a. line plot displaying how bikesharing varies throughout the day for each Season. 
b. bar chart which shows how average duration of a rider varies throughout a week- shows seasonal changes 
c. Bubble Plot displaying the number of people in each membership category 
d. Barplot showing the most popular Starting stations- Stations 3069, 3030, and 3005 were the three most popular
e. Barplot showing the most popular Ending stations- Stations 3005, 3031, and 3014 were the three most popular
f. Barplot showing how average distance varies between the seasons- Summer had the highest average distance

2. Timeline of my Data Analysis Procedure

3. Dashboard
a. Consists of 3 graphs: Bikeshare rentals throughout the year, Passholder Types, Bikeshare rentals throughout the week
b. A responsive dashboard that allows users to see how certain passholders varied over a week and even over a week. Can also provide input on which days do certain passholders bikeshare the most and so on.
